# PERSONAL-EXPENSE-TRACKER

📌 Project Overview

The Personal Expense Tracker is a simple command-line based Python application designed to help users record and analyze their daily expenses. This project focuses on solving a real-life problem — tracking personal spending — while strengthening core Python programming concepts.

The application allows users to add expenses with details such as date, category, amount, and optional notes. Users can view all recorded expenses, calculate the total expenses for the current month, and filter expenses based on specific categories like Food, Travel, Rent, etc.

This version of the project is built without file or database storage to primarily focus on Python logic, data structures, and program flow. It is ideal for beginners transitioning into intermediate-level Python programming.
